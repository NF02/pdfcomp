# pdf_comprimer
This script is meant to simplify ghostscript syntax and also to have a 
convenient and practical solution for *PDF compression*.
## Dependence
The only dependencies you need to install *ghostscript*. To do this, just go to
the repo of your Linux distro or to brew if it is mac os x and install the package of
the same name. For the rest the script can be put in a path to be more convenient.
